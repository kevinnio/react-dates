## A fork of `react-dates` that allows custom month/year selectors

This builds on top of [react-dates](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates), merging [this PR](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates/pull/1106) so we have custom month/year selectors. This is a temporary solution while the `react-dates` team merges the PR into the official package.

Special thanks to [Jordan VanderZwaag](https://github.com/jvanderz22), [Carl Scott](https://github.com/GoGoCarl) and all the people in the AirBnB's `react-dates` team.

Check out the docs in the [original repo](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates).

### How to install
